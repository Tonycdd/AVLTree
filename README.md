## AVL Tree Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a self-balancing binary search tree (AVL Tree) in C++. The AVL Tree supports standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and search while maintaining balance. Additionally, it includes extended features such as:

#### Rank Queries: Determine how many elements are smaller than a given key.

#### Index Access: Retrieve elements by their index in the sorted order.

## Features

#### Balanced Tree Operations: Insertion, deletion, and search with O(log n) complexity.

#### Rank Queries: Efficient rank calculation using a size attribute.

#### Index Access: Access elements by their index as if they were in a sorted array.

#### Custom Memory Management: Proper resource management with deep copy and destructor implementations.

#### Rotations: Single and double rotations to maintain balance.
